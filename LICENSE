This is a library for several Adafruit displays based on ST77* drivers.

  Works with the Adafruit 1.8" TFT Breakout w/SD card
    ----> http://www.adafruit.com/products/358
  The 1.8" TFT shield
    ----> https://www.adafruit.com/product/802
  The 1.44" TFT breakout
    ----> https://www.adafruit.com/product/2088
  as well as Adafruit raw 1.8" TFT display
    ----> http://www.adafruit.com/products/618
 
Check out the links above for our tutorials and wiring diagrams.
These displays use SPI to communicate, 4 or 5 pins are required to
interface (RST is optional).

Recent Arduino IDE releases include the Library Manager for easy installation. Otherwise, to download, click the DOWNLOAD ZIP button, uncompress and rename the uncompressed folder Adafruit_ST7735. Confirm that the Adafruit_ST7735 folder contains Adafruit_ST7735.cpp, Adafruit_ST7735.h and related source files. Place the Adafruit_ST7735 library folder your ArduinoSketchFolder/Libraries/ folder. You may need to create the Libraries subfolder if its your first library. Restart the IDE.

Also requires the Adafruit_GFX library for Arduino.
