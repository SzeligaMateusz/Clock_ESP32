This is a library for several Adafruit displays based on ST77* drivers.

  Works with the Adafruit 1.8" TFT Breakout w/SD card
    ----> http://www.adafruit.com/products/358
  The 1.8" TFT shield
    ----> https://www.adafruit.com/product/802
  The 1.44" TFT breakout
    ----> https://www.adafruit.com/product/2088
  as well as Adafruit raw 1.8" TFT display
    ----> http://www.adafruit.com/products/618
 
Check out the links above for our tutorials and wiring diagrams.
These displays use SPI to communicate, 4 or 5 pins are required to
interface (RST is optional).
